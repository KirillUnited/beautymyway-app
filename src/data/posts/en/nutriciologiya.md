# PERSONALIZED MEAL PLAN

Nowadays, many people strive for proper nutrition in order to maintain optimal functioning of their body, prevent ailments, diseases and their negative consequences. However, when people realize that their diet needs adjustment, they may begin to eliminate certain foods from their diet without proper advice, which in turn can lead to mistakes and undesirable consequences for the body. To avoid such negative consequences, it is important to carefully study the issue and seek professional help.

Our approach includes drawing up an individual nutrition plan that takes into account your preferences, lifestyle, medical contraindications and diseases. We eschew strict diets and strict restrictions in favor of nutrition that will not only improve your quality of life and health, but also help you avoid possible complications to which you may be predisposed.

## Initial consultation includes the following steps:

1. **Questionnaire**. We collect detailed information about your lifestyle, taste preferences, the presence of chronic diseases and medical contraindications, food allergies, and also analyze your previous attempts at weight control and analyze your food diary.

2. **Individual nutritional recommendations**. Based on the information collected, we develop a personalized nutrition plan tailored to your specific circumstances. This plan includes recommendations for your daily diet for the week or month, taking into account your taste preferences, health restrictions and your goals. We also provide advice on the proportions of ingredients that make up dishes and their nutritional value.

3. **Calculation of individual calorie intake**. We calculate your individual calorie intake based on your goals and lifestyle. We also select optimal amounts of macronutrients (biologically important components) and review nutraceuticals (dietary supplements and certain foods) based on your calorie intake.

4. **Selection of the optimal weight correction program**. Based on the data collected during the survey, we recommend the optimal weight correction program, taking into account your needs and preferences. We select methods, such as the plate method, interval feeding and calculating the BPJU, that best suit your situation."

## What results can be achieved by developing a personal diet?

A properly drawn up nutrition plan, following recommendations from experts in the field of nutrition, allows you to achieve noticeable changes and benefits in a relatively short time, such as:

- Improved appearance, including the condition of hair, skin and nails. This contributes to an overall feeling of youth and freshness.
- Reducing the risk of cancer, diabetes and other serious pathologies.
- Improved mood and reduced irritability. People who monitor their individual diet feel more confident and calm in any situation.
- Increased energy and enthusiasm levels. Those who follow a personalized diet often notice an increase in energy reserves, which is often missing in urban dwellers.
