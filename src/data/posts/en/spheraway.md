## SpheraWay for face and body

This technique has been proven to be highly effective! It is achieved through the use of microvibration compression, which alternates between compression and pressure on the tissues. This principle provides an excellent exercise for the blood vessels.

- Restore normal pressure in the venous vessels.
- Improve the rate of blood and lymphatic movement.
- Stimulate the synthesis of collagen fibres and elastin.
- Strengthen the walls of blood vessels.

Pulsating and rotating spheres are responsible for improving lymphatic flow. The movement and microvibration improves metabolism, microcirculation and the movement of lymph and venous blood. This helps to eliminate swelling and gently extract excess interstitial fluid. Since this method works at the level of removing excess fluid between tissues, the body also gets rid of harmful substances.

The unique advantage of the SpheraWay methodology is that there is no impact on the liver at all. All decomposition products are eliminated from the body through the excretory system.

## Benefits of SpheraWay:

1. You will be able to get rid of excessive volumes quickly and effectively
2. You won't have to worry about cellulite and uneven skin anymore
3. You will be able to eliminate swelling and recover from long flights and physical exertion
4. You will immediately see dramatic visual results immediately after the procedure is performed
5. No recovery period required
6. The complex and multifactorial effect on the skin is carried out step by step with maximum effectiveness
7. The skin will become firmer and you will be able to get rid of the appearance of laxity

## HOW THE PROCEDURE IS CARRIED OUT

**Step 1:** During the treatment, a special manipulator with 55 honeycomb-shaped spheres made of special silicone performs a deep lymphatic drainage massage. The rotation of microspheres and vibration at a certain frequency provide excellent results in prevention and treatment.

**Step 2:** The device's manipula is equipped with touch sensors that automatically adjust the intensity and frequency of treatment to meet each patient's unique needs. The technician also has the ability to manually adjust the vibration frequency. The weight of the nozzle is 1.8kg and has been determined by special calculations to ensure optimal effects on body wellness.

**Step 3:** Sensors on the arm scan problem areas such as lymph stagnation, fibrotic and cellulite areas, and fat accumulation. They then transmit this data to the machine to adjust the intensity of the treatment.

**Step 4:** The micro-vibrations of the manipulator during the procedure increase the tissue temperature by 2 degrees, which accelerates many processes in the body, such as metabolism in the cells and destruction of fat cells (adipocytes) and so on.
